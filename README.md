# Soccer_App
An app that connects UofA students who love soccer. Download the App, get in touch with people who are are also looking for other people to play with. The UofA ground is empty so often, and the weather is perfect these days for a game of soccer!

We use Expo which is a framework and platform for building React Native apps.

How to run the app locally:
go in UofASoccer directory
run - npx expo start
